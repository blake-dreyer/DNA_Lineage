# DNA_Lineage
Reads in Files containing potential DNA mutations and responds to user queries about the data

User Queries:
e = Evolve:
Input 2 DNA sequences following 'e' and the program will output whether or not the second sequence could be a mutation of the first

es = Evolutionary Steps:
Input 2 DNA sequences following 'es' and the program will output whether or not the second sequence could be a mutation of the first. If it is possible this query will display the number of evolutionary steps to get from the initial DNA sequence to the second.

ene = Energy and Evolution
Input 2 DNA sequences following 'es' and the program will output whether or not the second sequence could be a mutation of the first. If it is possible then the program will display how much energy input is required to make the evolution occur.

path = Path:
Similar to the 'es' query however instead of displaying the number of steps it will display the full path through each evolution.

q = Quit:
Exits the Program
